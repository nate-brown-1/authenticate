# Lab 06: Basic Authentication

## Authentication System Phase 1

Deploy an Express server that implements Basic Authentication, with signup and signin capabilities, using a Postgres database for storage.

### Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 3-Phase build of an authentication system, written in Express. The following core requirements detail the functionality for this phase of the project.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create a new account so that I may later login
  - Using an HTTP REST client or a web form:
    - Make a POST request to the/signup route with username and password.
    - Your server should support both JSON and FORM data as input.
    - On a successful account creation, return a 201 status with the user object in the body.
    - On any error, trigger your error handler with an appropriate error.
- As a user, I want to login to my account so that I may access protected information
  - Using am HTTP REST client, or a web form:
    - Make a POST request to the /signin route.
    - Send a basic authentication header with a properly encoded username and password combination.
    - On a successful account login, return a 200 status with the user object in the body.
    - On any error, trigger your error handler with the message “Invalid Login”.

### Application Structure (proposed)

NOTE: The majority of our work for this server will be done within the src/auth folder. The rest of the system should be generic express. Why? It’s our intention to be able to “lift” the auth folder and “drop” it into any other server (such as our API server) and be able to use authorization to “protect” those CRUD routes. This makes our entire auth system very modular. Think of index.js and server.js as nothing more than the basics to get a server started, with 100% of the actual logic living within the auth module

### Technical Requirements / Notes

You have been supplied a “monolithic” express server in the starter-code folder which fulfills the above requirements. To complete the work for this phase, refactor the provided server using best practices, modularizing the code and providing tests, as follows:

### Basic Server

Extract the core server logic into 2 files:

- index.js (entry point)
  - Connect to the database
  - Require the ‘server’ and start it

- server.js service wiring
  - Exports an express app/server and a start method

- Authentication Modules
  - Keep your authentication related files in a folder called /auth so they are independent of the server itself.

- Extract the authentication logic for /signin as middleware.
  - Create a new node module.
  - Interact with the headers and the users model.
  - Add the user record (if valid) to the request object and call next().
  - Call next() with an error in the event of a bad login.
- Extract the Sequelize Model into a separate module.
  - Model the user data.
  - Add a before-create hook in the model … Before we save a record:
  - Hash the plain text password given before you save a user to the database.
  - Create a method in the schema to authenticate a user using the hashed password.
  - Create a module to house all of routes for the authentication system.

- Create a POST route for /signup
  - Accepts either a JSON object or FORM Data with the keys “username” and “password”.
  - Creates a new user record in a Postgres database.
  - Returns a 201 with the created user record.
- Create a POST route for /signin.
  - Use your basic authentication middleware to perform the actual login task.
  - router.post('/signin', basicAuth, (req,res) => {});
  - When validated, send a JSON object as the response with the following properties:
    - user: The users’ database record

### Testing

You should manually test your routes using an HTTP REST client, either in the terminal or an HTTP REST client with a GUI. Additionally, you are required to write automated tests as well:

POST to /signup to create a new user.

POST to /signin to login as a user (use basic auth).

Need tests for auth middleware and the routes.

Does the middleware function (send it a basic header).

Do the routes assert the requirements (signup/signin).

This is going to require more “end to end” testing than you’ve done in the past.

To test signin, your tests actually need to create a user first, then try and login.

i.e. The signin test will rely on the success of the signup test
